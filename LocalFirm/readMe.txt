Nester.m just needs an excel file as an input.
ex:
Nester('somefile.csv')


Nester 4-1 6-1.xlsx contains Local Firm's actual data. Its on sheet 3, column F. There's more information in that spreadsheet.
Nester 4-1 6-1.xlsx is > 100MB, and so is too large to include in the repo.

actual.xlsx is only the info from that column
